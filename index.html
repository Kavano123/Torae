        Okay so basically, you know I'm not the best when it comes to writing and all of that. 
        The pass few weeks I have been experiencing an immense amount of stress and I didn't know how to cope with it. 
        You are the only reason that I have gotten this far. You have believed in me from the very start. Even when 
        I lost hope, you didn't. 

        You told me to write how I've been feeling with this fight. I have so much emotions and I tried 
        writing it out, but at the end all I could think about is you. All I can do is talk about is you. 
        All my emotions I feel, even with the nerves of the fight, I just want to write about you.
        I know you told me to write it out and not type but I still never find paper and a pen. But in the end I just 
        want to talk about you. 

        I know you tried to help me the other day with the emotions and telling me that I did my best
        at the time that I fought. I shouldn't have told you what I did. I was just feeling stress and didn't know
        how to handle it. Of course you didn't deserve to be spoken like that and I know that I'm wrong for it. 
        I really am sorry for that. I just don't know how to handle any type of emotion. I just get so overwhelmed at the
        slightest bit of emotions and I don't know how to react. 

        You may think I don't love you or show you that I love you. But I do. I show you how I know it. I don't always want to
        go out and eat so we don't have to talk, I like to because dad shows his love with food. I may not cook like him but I 
        can make you want to eat. Especially because you hardly eat, and drink water, which is bad for you and why you get the 
        headaches. 
        You are the only person that I would want to eat food with, the only person I want to go to the movies with, the only 
        person I want to spend time with. 

        I'm not very good with my words but at the end of the day, I really do love you and I always will. No matter what you may say
        no matter what you may think, I will always be ther for you and I will always love you. I'm the weed in your yard, you don't want 
        it there, but you will always have it. I remember the first day we met, that was my favorite moment. It was the first time I could 
        say my hear skipped a beat. I was so happy and excited to see you, I didn't know how to react, I had to fiddle with my pen the 
        whole time, playing with the cap and making the clicking noise. That pen cap did not last, but the memory did. I still have those 
        coins of when we played pool from our first meet up, to the R5 you won from campus when I said your lecturer robbed you'll and 
        gave less money than you supposed to. I remember when you beat me in Ice-hockey, you were so excited and I just smiled seeing you 
        and I thought you are just amazing.

        I have every hairband I ever stole from you when I had long hair. My Atos is not the same without havning your hairbands on the 
        gear selector. I have made many mistakes in the almost 22 years I've been alive, but loving you will never be a mistake, it would 
        be the greatest feeling not only for my 22 years of existance but also my whole life. I just have so much of love for you I still 
        don't know how to show it. I don't want to give you the ick or make you think I'm to needy. Yes I am a bit bad when it comes to 
        realizing the little things, but I do remember the little things, the day I first held you in my arms, me almost crying with you 
        when mum was in hospital but I tried to be strong becasue I needed to be there for you. I'm always over worked and over stimulated 
        its because I am the man and I want you to know that I would always be the provider no matter what. Just like how dad gets you 
        everything you want, I want to be like that as well. I still get shy around you, like not a bad type, but I have so much feelings
        I don't know how to react or when it's appropriate as well. I always want to be holding you, and being in your presence. 
        When judgement day comes, and you are chosen, I would do everything possible to find a way and be with you. Devote my live to 
        Christ, tell him no matter what at the end of the day I will be with you. 

        The brain, the eyes, the feet, the hands, the body may say I don't care, but my heart speaks everyday and it always has the love 
        for you. At the end of the day, when it comes to love, its the heart that makes the decision. The brain may say something but the 
        heart knows, and my heart knows it wants you. If you look in it, not only would you see all the junk food I have clogging my 
        arteries, you'll see only you in there. I hold every moment spent with you close to my heart, you just have one memory on the 
        shelf of memories, but I have our whole 4 years. Starting from 26th April till now. From the first "Hii" I ever said. From getting 
        jealous of when you had Wyatt the weasel as your wallpaper. The very first time I said I love you. The first time you told me you 
        love me. Everything I hold dearest to my heart. Every gift you ever gotten for me, I keep it safe and think about you non stop. I 
        think about you constantly, when I'm at work, gym, no matter where I am, I think of you. When I have bad dreams, you're the first 
        person I think about to try and calm myself down in the dream, if I know I have control in the dream I build so many futures for us 
        within that few moments and my biggest annoyance at that point is waking up to that neeger Elsa vaccuming right by my head. 

        I have so much to say, I'm just not the best at showing my affection, I don't know a lot when it comes to all that, and its not 
        that you had to teach me to love you, it's more like you taught me how to show my feelings to you. I love you and no matter what you 
        say, no matter what you think, you are my home, my one and only, and I'll be dammed if you had to think otherwise. You will meet the 
        real bushknife Vano, with the onion knot bun and the pink gown standing by your gate. I think where I'm trying to get at is that 
        even though you may think I don't love you be it subconcious or whatever, I'm telling you, you're wrong, because I love you so much
        that you genuinly would not be able to comprehend. You are my best friend, and I will not lose you over my stupidity and laziness. At 
        the end of the day, you are in my life and I want to keep you in it. We have our misunderstandings and our ups and downs, but no matter
        what I will love you through all. At the end of the day, I may not be the best when it comes to showing the little things, I may need to 
        be told what to do, but I do remember everything. It's just when I'm with you I get like a boy that just spent time with his crush and 
        doesn't know how to react. Because thats me. 

        I LOVE YOU‚ù§Ô∏è
